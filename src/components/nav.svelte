<!-- 
Even though we're using <a> tags, Svelte recognizes paths that
are relative to our project and does client-side routing (i.e. without doing
a full page refresh)
-->

<nav class="flex justify-center w-full">
	<a class="mx-4 text-lg" href="/">Home</a>
	<a class="mx-4 text-lg" href="/about">About</a>
</nav>
